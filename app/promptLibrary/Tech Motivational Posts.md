### Example Markdown Embeds with Tech-Themed Motivational Captions 

> [!quote] ![Google Maps](https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=maps.google.com&sz=16) 
> "Google Maps doesn’t say, 'Hey, you’re going the wrong way!' when you take a wrong turn. It simply adjusts your route and tells you the next turn you should take. And just like that, maybe you’re not off track in life. Perhaps your route just got redirected and it might take longer and further to get there, but guess what—you’re still on track. Keep moving. You’re getting there." 

### Markdown Embed Syntax For each motivational post, you can use the following template: ```markdown > * ![Favicon](https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=${domain}&sz=16) **Caption**: _${motivational caption here}_
