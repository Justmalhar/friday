## âœ… Tasks

Write a data view markdown code block to load tasks from Todo.md file under # Today



Certainly! Here's a sample data view markdown code block that you can use to load tasks from a `Todo.md` file under the tag `# Today`. This assumes you are using a system that supports DataView (like Obsidian).


## âœ… Tasks

```dataview
table
    text as "Task"
from "Todo.md"
where contains(tags, "# Today")
sort file.mtime desc
```

In this code block:
- The `table` command creates a table format for displaying tasks.
- `text as "Task"` specifies that the task text will be displayed in the column labeled "Task".
- The `from "Todo.md"` line indicates that it should look for tasks in the specified file.
- The `where contains(tags, "# Today")` filters tasks to only show those tagged with `# Today`.
- Finally, it sorts the results by modification time in descending order.

Make sure your system is set up to recognize and process DataView queries properly!
