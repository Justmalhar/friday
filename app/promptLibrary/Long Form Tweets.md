🧵 Why is Kedarnath known as 'Jagrit Mahadev'? Here's a story that'll give you goosebumps. Read till the end!👇 #Kedarnath #Mahadev

---

1/ Once, a devoted follower of Bhagwan Shiv began a pilgrimage to Kedarnath. With no transport options back then, he walked all the way, asking for directions at every turn and constantly praying to Shiv. It took him months to finally arrive at Kedarnath Dham.

---

2/ When he reached, the temple doors were just being closed. Kedarnath opens for only six months each year, and the doors cannot reopen once closed. Heartbroken, he begged the priest for a glimpse of Bhagwan Shiv, but the rule was strict.

---

3/ Desperate, he cried and prayed to Shiv, hoping for a miracle. As night fell, he was left alone, cold, hungry, and thirsty. But his faith remained unshaken. Then, an old sage appeared, listened to his story, and offered him food and reassurance.

---

4/ At dawn, he woke to find the sage gone. Just then, the priest arrived, surprised to see him. The man asked, "Why are you back so soon if the temple is closed for six months?" The priest, puzzled, replied, "I closed the doors six months ago and just returned today."

---

5/ Astonished, the man exclaimed, "But I only arrived yesterday!" The priest and the group were stunned. Surviving alone in that weather for six months was impossible. Then, he described the sage: long matted hair, trident in hand, and dressed in deerskin.

---

6/ Realizing it was Shiv himself, everyone around fell at the man's feet, saying, "You are truly blessed to have had the darshan of Bhagwan Shiv." This is why Kedarnath is known as 'Jagrit Mahadev' – ever awake to bless his devotees. #HarHarMahadev 🙏

🧵 The secret of the 84 lakh yonis (life cycles) in the scriptures... This will shock you. Read till the end!👇 #84LakhYonis #SpiritualTruths

---

1/ According to ancient texts, a soul is born as a tree around 30 lakh times. This existence is seen as the most painful, enduring harsh heat, storms, and rains. Trees face endless suffering as their branches break, leaves fall, and humans cut them down.

---

2/ Then, one is born as a bird approximately 11 lakh times. They rely on trees for shelter, eat whatever they find, and sacrifice for their young, who often don’t return after learning to fly. It’s a life of survival and resilience.

---

3/ After that, a soul experiences animal life about 20 lakh times. Here, the struggle for survival is intense. Animals constantly face threats from stronger predators, hiding in caves, fighting for food, and enduring a life where strength determines survival.

---

4/ Among animals, the cow is considered the most evolved and sacred. After countless animal lives, the soul finally reaches human life, undergoing 400,000 human forms. Early lives are primitive, with survival instincts, evolving gradually into more conscious beings.

---

5/ Achieving human life is rare and precious. It’s a reminder to utilize this form for spiritual growth and devotion. “If you’ve attained human birth, make sure to do Hari Bhajan.”
