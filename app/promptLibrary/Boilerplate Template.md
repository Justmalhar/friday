## Development Guidelines

### Coding Standards 
- Follow the **Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide**: https://github.com/airbnb/javascript.

### Branching Strategy 
- Use **Git Flow**: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow.

### Commits 
- Write meaningful commit messages using this structure:
  ```plaintext
  type(scope): subject
  
  body (optional)
  
  footer (optional)
  ```

### Pull Requests 
1. Ensure your code follows coding standards and passes all tests before creating a PR.

2. Fill out the PR template detailing what changes have been made, why, and how to test them.

---

## Testing 

### Unit Tests 
Use Jest for writing unit tests:

```bash
npm run test:unit 
```
Or with yarn:
```bash 
yarn test:unit 
```

Place all unit tests in the `test/unit` directory.

### Integration Tests 
Integration tests should be placed in `test/integration`. Run them with:

```bash 
npm run test:integration 
```
Or with yarn:
```bash 
yarn test:integration 
```

---

## Deployment 

### Staging Environment 

1. Merge your feature branch into `develop`.

2. The CI/CD pipeline will automatically deploy to the staging environment.

### Production Environment 

1. Ensure all code is merged into `main`.

2. The CI/CD pipeline will automatically deploy to production upon merging into `main`.
